<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">We started Print a Thing by asking a simple question: “What would you like to make today?” The world of 3D printing is wonderfully diverse and this technology has the amazing ability to bring projects to life. Best of all, 3D printing opens doors for people to create in ways they would not otherwise be able to without access to commercial manufacturing facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So what would you like to make today? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">If you’re trying to answer that question, it helps if you understand the things that this technology can do. Hint, it’s more than you think. 3D printing isn’t only for complex engineering projects or to support advances in medicine. Though it is constantly used for breakthroughs in both of those fields. In truth 3D printing is active in several different areas and you can use it as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">If you’re looking to better understand the projects you can create with 3D printing, our Get Inspired page is a great place to start. </span><a href="https://printathing.com/inspire/"><span style="color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;">Click here</span></a><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> and you’ll see some of our favorite projects that people like you have created using 3D printing. Candle holders, holiday decorations and props from your favorite movies, you can make any of these things with a desire and the right technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">It all starts with your idea. Think about that thing you’ve always wanted – 3D printing can help you create it. Once you’ve finalized your concept with a 3D model of the item you want, place your order with us and we’ll find the best 3D printer to deliver your project. The project is printed and the finished product is delivered to your door hassle free. And that’s it. Suddenly that item you’ve always wanted is now the item you’re so glad to have. It’s that easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So… what would like to make today?</span></p>

<p>If you’ve found this blog during your first searches into the world of 3D printing, welcome. You’re on your way to learning more about this exciting technology and delving deeper into what 3D printing can do for you. This blog is designed to act as your springboard into the world of 3D printing by giving you insight into some of the most important things you need to know about this technology.</p>
<p>Ready to learn more? Great. Then let’s begin.</p>
<p>Here are five things you need to know about 3D printing.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s older than you think. You may have just started hearing about 3D printing but the technology dates all the way back to the 1980s. Lasers were used to trace the desired pattern and when the tracing was done, the project was submerged in liquid polymer.</li>
<li>You can print almost anything. 3D printing draws lots of attention for its use in engineering and in creating medical solutions but it can be used to print almost anything. All you need is a tangible model and a 3D printer can often replicate it.</li>
<li>3D printing cuts waste. The difference between making something <em>from</em> something and making something <em>into</em> something may seem trivial but it has a big impact when it comes to waste. 3D printing uses the latter meaning only material sufficient to create the project is used and your not creating your finished project from a larger raw material. That difference means there is little-to-no waste.</li>
<li>3D printing <a href="https://printathing.com/inspire/">expands your options</a>. In the past you were bound to choose from the products companies offered. No longer. 3D printing allows you to go out and create that perfect part, project or piece to match your needs. Frequent printers find this most satisfying and innovators use the technology to create the parts they need for things that haven’t even been invented yet.</li>
<li>Getting started is easy. You don’t have to have a Master’s in engineering to start your own project, you just have to have an idea and a model. We’ll take it from there. Once you’ve created your own concept, fill out our easy-order form and we’ll match your job with a talented 3D printer that can bring your project to life. The finished product will be delivered to your door, ready for you to enjoy.</li>
</ol>
