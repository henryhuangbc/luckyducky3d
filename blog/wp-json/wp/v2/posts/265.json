They flew around in wheel less cars, lived in the sky, had robot maids and ate food that was quickly created in a machine. The show originally aired in the 60s and nearly 50 years later we still don\u2019t have those flying cars, sky way homes and robot maids, but food made by machines? Well, one out of four isn&#8217;t bad.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-267\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-300x225.png\" alt=\"US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-300x225.png 300w, \/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-285x214.png 285w, \/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am.png 938w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center<\/p>\n<p>Today the United States Army is seeking new ways to manage its food supply lines while customizing nutrition and it thinks it\u2019s found a way to make food Jetsons style, through the power of 3D printing. \u201cFood could be printed with the exact requirement a warfighter needs,\u201d Lauren Oleksyk, a food technologist who works at the US Army\u2019s Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center told <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techinsider.io\/army-3d-print-soldiers-food-2016-2\">Tech Insider<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds impossible, the stuff of, well, The Jetsons but Oleksyk believes the quick manufacturing of food, using 3D printing is not only possible, it\u2019s doable within the next 10-15 years. In fact, it\u2019s prognosticated that by that time our soldiers will be outfitted with devices that measure not only their physiological status but their nutritional status as well and these measurements would be delivered to the solider so he or she was aware of their current status.<\/p>\n<p>The information collected by these devices will then be returned to base as well where officials could use it to print dietary solutions that will correct any deficiencies the soldier is currently showing. The data would also allow them to alter their food printing choices based on the physical body composition of the solider.<\/p>\n<p>Using today\u2019s technology simple foods like peanut butter filling can be made in half an hour but as the technology improves experts expect 3D printers will be able to tackle more complex foodstuffs while also printing simple food stuffs in less time. And once we master the art of printing food bars, can George Jetsen and his flying car really be that far behind?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I was a child one of my favorite television shows was The Jetsons.
