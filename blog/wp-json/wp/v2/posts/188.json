Jim, at Grass Roots Engineering, is\u00a0taking that\u00a0idea one step further by using 3D printing to literally transport himself thanks to his own 3D printed kayak. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The vessel, which Jim says cost him about $500 to make, is 16.5 feet long and made from ABS plastic, screws, a little caulk and a handful of inserts. It\u2019s a colorful design that incorporates 28 different 3D printed sections, which are connected by thermoplastic brass inserts, and most importantly, it floats. Jim says he\u2019s already traveled around in it several times. You can even see pictures of him doing so <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grassrootsengineering.com\/blog\/page\/2\/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">in his blog here.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grassrootsengineering.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/kayak_001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">In order to tackle such a large project and prevent warping and cracking, Jim had to make a few modifications to his 3D printer. You can learn more about those modifications <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grassrootsengineering.com\/blog\/mymachine\/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">. The finished product features a hull that is 6mm thick and includes a complete ribbing structure for added strength and stability. There are even points where handles, cameras or other items can be added at a later date. You can learn more about all of the exact measurements of the kayak on the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.grassrootsengineering.com\/blog\/page\/2\/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">Grass Roots Engineering blog<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">. Great work Jim! Your kayak is certainly one of a kind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">So what would you like to make today? Whatever it is, 3D printing can help you do it. Every single time we think we understand the boundaries of this amazing technology people like Jim come along and completely reopen the realm of what 3D printing is capable of doing.
