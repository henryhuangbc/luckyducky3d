Consider this: in the food industry, you can now print pasta and chocolate if you have the right source material. In addition to making tasty treats easy,\u00a0diabetics and others with food allergies have the power to print proper food that keeps them from getting sick. NASA has also begun to play with this technology for astronauts to print food in space. Could you imagine printing your own food?
