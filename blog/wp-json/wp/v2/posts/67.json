In many cases that goal is to solve a problem through design, to test or tweak\u00a0a design, retest it, or improve upon the design in some other way. And once they solve this problem, the next challenge presents itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s true you can use your own printer\u00a0to print\u00a0hundreds or thousands\u00a0of design impressions, this is extremely time consuming. Most people don&#8217;t want to babysit their printer for that length of time or expose it to the wear and tear.<\/p>\n<p>Another option for those larger projects\u00a0is to search\u00a03D printing, roll the dice and hope that you find a printer that can handle your order. You may find a reputable printer in this way\u00a0but you also\u00a0spend a lot of time vetting out the companies and people you are talking with.<\/p>\n<p>A third option is to\u00a0go to the large commercial printers. They have the equipment and manpower to get the job done, they also have the overhead to go with it. This option, albeit a suitable one, can get very expensive.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, \u00a0you have the option to use a 3D printing network, one that has the understanding to make sure your job is done right.
