There will be a day when, with the push of one button, you can print a new pair of jeans, a new mailbox or a light fixture for your front porch. The only limit is your imagination.<\/p>\n<p>People across every industry are using 3D printing to create the items they need. You can even find people using 3D printing parts for their firearms and other weapons. While\u00a0this creativity and\u00a0usefulness is inspiring to\u00a0see, it does raise the question of regulation. How will 3D\u00a0printing be regulated in the future and what\u00a0freedoms will we still continue to enjoy as printers?\u00a0As with anything else layers of protection need to be put into place as the technology grows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An Early Example<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When we consider the amount of regulation that may lie in the future for 3D printing,\u00a0it helps to\u00a0look at an existing example in another piece of incredibly popular technology &#8211; the cell phone. The amount of regulation around cell phones in the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s was minimal at best. Today however,\u00a0the big cell phone companies are negotiating with state and federal governments as well as\u00a0law enforcement agencies across the globe in order to secure usage rights.<\/p>\n<p>Will 3D printing follow suit? It&#8217;s tough to say for sure. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3D printing is a large and growing industry but it is not yet \u00a0dominated by one or two corporations who make all the rules based solely on their bottom line.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, there are still many players in the market. That is very exciting for those of us in the industry but we can&#8217;t afford to ignore the technological examples that have come before. 3D printing, like so many other industries,\u00a0still comes down to people making the best decision at the right time, not just for themselves but for all of us. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The growth of 3D printing has shown\u00a0how computer-generated designs can be brought to life.
