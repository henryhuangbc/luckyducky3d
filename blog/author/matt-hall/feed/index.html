										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-61" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-multicolor-mobile-phone-plasti-48646388_1-300x200.jpg" alt="MultiColor Mobile Phone plastic cases on a white background" width="300" height="200" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-multicolor-mobile-phone-plasti-48646388_1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-multicolor-mobile-phone-plasti-48646388_1-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do you think the average person knows about 3D printing? The answer might surprise you. The public&#8217;s understanding of 3D printing has grown as the industry continues to earn major news coverage and 3D printing is also gaining popularity with <a href="https://printathing.com/blog/3d-printing-is-for-more-than-just-trinkets/">the world&#8217;s largest brands</a> as well.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while this exposure increases the general public&#8217;s awareness of 3D printing, it leaves them longing to learn more about how 3D printing really works. For that information they turn to the web and resources such as this site and TechCrunch where Andreas Bastian <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/28/understanding-the-3d-printing-ecosystem-breaking-it-down-and-building-it-up/#.pobgtq:rWRs">gives a great breakdown </a>of how the 3D printing ecosystem is working today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key takeaways from Bastian&#8217;s piece are two-fold.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Today’s 3D printing creations are designed for old manufacturing processes.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bulk of the products, trinkets and fun designs being created in the 3D printing market are most likely carryovers that were originally  designed to be manufacture via other technologies. Projects created solely for 3D printing exist in the market as well and while they are not the norm yet, expect their number to grow as the technology continues to develop and gain awareness. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Hardware and software must work together.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make this technology efficient the software has to improve to and better align with the existing hardware. This will allow applications to correct a mistakes in real time while also allowing users to check the status remote and share the status of the job with other users. Software is what makes our world go and that will absolutely apply here as well.</span></p>
<p>3D printing is still a very new technology, especially as it pertains to the mass public. But as the industry grows, so too will their awareness and that&#8217;s an exciting prospect for 3D printers everywhere. Because innovation always appears a little more quickly when it is driven by demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-electronic-d-plastic-printer-51976933.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-55" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-electronic-d-plastic-printer-51976933-300x200.jpg" alt="Electronic three dimensional plastic printer during work in school laboratory." width="300" height="200" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-electronic-d-plastic-printer-51976933-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-electronic-d-plastic-printer-51976933-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The growth of 3D printing has shown how computer-generated designs can be brought to life. There will be a day when, with the push of one button, you can print a new pair of jeans, a new mailbox or a light fixture for your front porch. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>People across every industry are using 3D printing to create the items they need. You can even find people using 3D printing parts for their firearms and other weapons. While this creativity and usefulness is inspiring to see, it does raise the question of regulation. How will 3D printing be regulated in the future and what freedoms will we still continue to enjoy as printers? As with anything else layers of protection need to be put into place as the technology grows.</p>
<p><strong>An Early Example</strong></p>
<p>When we consider the amount of regulation that may lie in the future for 3D printing, it helps to look at an existing example in another piece of incredibly popular technology &#8211; the cell phone. The amount of regulation around cell phones in the 80’s and early 90’s was minimal at best. Today however, the big cell phone companies are negotiating with state and federal governments as well as law enforcement agencies across the globe in order to secure usage rights.</p>
<p>Will 3D printing follow suit? It&#8217;s tough to say for sure. <span style="font-weight: 400;">3D printing is a large and growing industry but it is not yet  dominated by one or two corporations who make all the rules based solely on their bottom line.  Instead, there are still many players in the market. That is very exciting for those of us in the industry but we can&#8217;t afford to ignore the technological examples that have come before. 3D printing, like so many other industries, still comes down to people making the best decision at the right time, not just for themselves but for all of us. </span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D printed transmission for a Toyota 22RE engine</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s blog we wanted to take a moment to highlight the latest creation of Santa Cruz, California&#8217;s own, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Harrell who has reverse-engineered a Toyota 22RE. It&#8217;s a unique feat that Thingaverse users and the national media were very certainly enamored with. Since his creation, it appears imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. To date, no less than eight people have also printed the engine thanks to Harrell&#8217;s design. Many more are in process. </span></p>
<p>Harrell says it took about 48 hours to print all of the transmission&#8217;s pieces. The only pieces he did not print were the 18-623zz bearings, 3mm rod,  3mm washers and other miscellaneous pieces such as bolts and screws. The result is a true piece of automotive art, made possible simply through 3D printing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transmission4.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="472" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re interested in building one yourself, good news. While a transmission is certainly a complex machine, Harrell has created the diagrams to show you how to put it together. And building this machine with 3D parts represents a much smaller time commitment than conventional construction. Contact us today for a copy of the diagram. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GE-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GE-logo.png" alt="GE logo" width="225" height="225" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GE-logo.png 225w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GE-logo-150x150.png 150w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GE-logo-174x174.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps my favorite thing about 3D printing is that it has given creative people a way to bring their creations to life. Whether you&#8217;ve designed a trinket, toy, bracelet or part, 3D printing can make it real for you. That is cool and I have seen some neat designs come to life just as their owners had always hoped they would.</p>
<p>But the future of 3D printing doesn’t stop there. This technology has the power to help the greater good as well. In the years ahead you will see thousands of examples of 3D printing making products more efficient, stronger, lighter or cost effective.</p>
<p>And for companies like General Electric (GE), that future is already here. GE has completely bought into 3D printing and the impact it can have on manufacturing. This of course is just the latest example of GE&#8217;s constant search for new innovations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company already sponsors The Tonight Show&#8217;s young inventor segments and starting in 2016, GE will  use 3D printed parts in aircraft engines. These 3D printed parts include fuel nozzles and turbine systems for use in engine platforms. In addition, GE researchers, through a partnership with Snecma (</span><a href="http://www.snecma.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.snecma.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), are producing CFM LEAP engines that will have 19 3D-printed fuel nozzles in the combustion system. These new parts are significantly lighter than the current nozzle offerings and the simpler design requires only one part instead of 18. Finally, 3D printing is allowing the team at GE to create more intricate designs to allow for better cooling pathways and a durability five times greater than conventional parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just a few of the ways GE is leading the market in 3D printing innovation. Now it&#8217;s up to all of us to keep pace. To read more on GE global research go to: </span><a href="http://www.geglobalresearch.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.geglobalresearch.com</span></a></p>

<p>The executives at Adidas and Nike are tasked with being leaders. It is their responsibility to grow their brands globally, find new products to grab market share, sign superstar athletes to represent them and look for ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors. To accomplish many of these goals, both of these brands are turning to 3D printing.</p>
<p>Nike executives visualize the day when their customers print shoes in their own homes. They may even be able to use Nike’s ‘s design technology to create their own custom shoe. The process would then allow customers to purchase the design and print them at home.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">A leader in shoe customization for years, Nike started expanding customer options years ago with simple modifications that allowed customers to pick their color scheme or add their initials. Today however, 3D printing is taking the concept of individuality to a whole new level, giving customers truly unlimited customization. And best of all, 3D printing enables customers to get their one-of-a-kind shoes as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-112" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/adidas_group_pitch_video-300x200.jpg" alt="adidas_group_pitch_video" width="300" height="200" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/adidas_group_pitch_video-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/adidas_group_pitch_video-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/adidas_group_pitch_video.jpg 1984w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adidas is keeping pace with Nike thanks to Futurecraft 3D. Adidas goal is to use the technology to target runners. With Futurecraft 3D customers can go to an Adidas store jump on a treadmill for a quick jog and then you have their shoes printed. The shoes they receive are customized to their feet and running style. How’s that for instant feedback? For runners the technology is invaluable and Adidas sees Futurecraft as their sandbox to try new things and show their intent to lead the industry. And Adidas isn’t done yet. They have partnered with Materialise and you can expect more groundbreaking designs, courtesy of this partnership, in the near future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-111" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adidas-shoe-300x107.jpg" alt="Adidas shoe" width="300" height="107" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adidas-shoe-300x107.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adidas-shoe.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of these brands realize the technology of 3D printing can revolutionize how shoes are created and also how they are delivered to customers. It&#8217;s exciting news, and, in an industry where speed is king, the move to 3D printing makes perfect sense. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Georgia',serif;">Engineers have always pushed the envelope when it comes to design and solving problems. But new technology is helping them reshape that envelope instead. With 3D printing engineers have the ability to test designs more quickly without prolonged waiting for casting or machining. 3D printing also expands an engineer&#8217;s material options, allowing him or her to find the right material for the right project or design.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-50" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_1bigstock-d-printer-in-action-62777212_2-300x200.jpg" alt="Detail of 3D printer printing a vase ** Note: Soft Focus at 100%, best at smaller sizes" width="300" height="200" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_1bigstock-d-printer-in-action-62777212_2-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_1bigstock-d-printer-in-action-62777212_2-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The future of many engineer projects is tied to 3D printing and industries across the market will adapt this technology to fuel their innovations. 3D printing will change how those currently in the engineering field and those earning engineering degrees do their jobs.</p>
<p>Looking for examples? Consider this: in the food industry, you can now print pasta and chocolate if you have the right source material. In addition to making tasty treats easy, diabetics and others with food allergies have the power to print proper food that keeps them from getting sick. NASA has also begun to play with this technology for astronauts to print food in space. Could you imagine printing your own food? It is not that far away.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health care is also starting to test the uses of <a href="https://printathing.com/blog/the-future-of-organ-donation-3d-printing/">3D printing to create organs.</a> The technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also been used to create prosthetics, hearing aids, joints, etc. </span></p>
<h3>What engineering degrees will be changed by 3D printing?</h3>
<p><strong>Mechanical</strong></p>
<p>3D printing has made producing objects with complex structures easy compared to traditional methods. With 3D printing, mechanical engineers will be able to learn the latest techniques in their industry more quickly and revolutionize the manufacturing processes.</p>
<p><strong>Civil</strong></p>
<p>Today, in China, entire homes are being built with 3D printers. This technology allows civil engineers to experiment with shapes and materials that are not even possible with current building techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Material &amp; Chemical Science</strong></p>
<p>This particular field may see the greatest growth thanks to 3D printing. By expanding and finding new materials to use for source materials, 3D printers may be able to expand their creation capabilities and offer more consumers more access to the goods they use every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The team at Stratasys Direct Manufacturing introduced SMS Research Advisors and did a large independent study that was sent out to 40,000 designers, engineers and executives. In all, 700 people completed this survey and 40 percent said they work at companies who take in more than $50 million in revenue. That is important because these results are driven by leaders at successful companies that will be leading the industry.</p>
<p>The report set out to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will companies use 3D printing over the next 3 years?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do they see as the obstacles 3D printing adoption?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the business value?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will product development evolve?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who will invest in owning the technology?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What role will the service provider play?  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-81" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart-300x239.jpg" alt="Chart" width="335" height="267" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart-300x239.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey showed that engineers see 3D printing as a tool to fabricate objects that have extreme design complexities. That is fascinating because it bucks the trend that 3D printing is fun and of use only when you want to produce a trinket instead of a complex item that fits into your manufacturing process.</span></p>
<p>The same research shows however that equipment cost concerns remain.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chart-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-82" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chart-2-300x113.jpg" alt="chart 2" width="359" height="135" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chart-2-300x113.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chart-2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Leaping the hurdle</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies looking to capitalize on 3D printings capabilities while controlling their costs, Print a Thing’s network can help them print their parts and designs without investing millions in equipment and training. Simply design your part and place your order, it&#8217;s easy and leaves you time for the things you&#8217;d rather be doing &#8211; like surveys. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of organ donation is 3D printing.</p>
<p>Jenny Morber a freelance science writer took an amazing look at how Organovo, amongst others, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/3d-printed-organs/">is leading the charge to change the organ donation landscape.</a></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/warhol-heart.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/warhol-heart-300x169.jpg" alt="warhol-heart" width="300" height="169" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/warhol-heart-300x169.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/warhol-heart-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/warhol-heart.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Veterans of 3D printing know firsthand the amazing feeling of seeing their creation come to life. But now imagine the feeling that comes with watching your 3D-printed creation actually save a life. The team at Organovo is looking to create those moments and ensure many of the struggles that exist with organ donation potentially disappear.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These exciting developments are still most likely years or decades away but progress is being made every day. Dr. Bolan, of Clemson University, is pioneering this technology and he currently uses 3D printers to build complex shapes off sample blueprints. The research needed to construct a heart already exists but scientists need 3D printers to build the “scaffolding” so they can bathe it in the nutrients and cells from a healthy organ. This technology is so cutting edge it seems to come from a science fiction novel and not the research lab of a university.</span></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/organovo-3d-printer1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-73" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/organovo-3d-printer1-300x169.jpg" alt="organovo-3d-printer" width="300" height="169" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/organovo-3d-printer1-300x169.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/organovo-3d-printer1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/organovo-3d-printer1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for those of us in the 3D printing space, this truth is much more exciting. Every day we are solving engineering problems and finding solutions that make us more efficient. And in the future, many of those solutions could turn out to be latterly live-saving. </span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re in the market for a 3D print, Leapfrog, one of the leaders in the 3D printing industry, is ready to help. But why would a seller of 3D printers <a href="http://www.lpfrg.com/blog/want-to-have-a-3d-print-made/">direct you to services other than selling you a printer?</a> The answer is simple. Leapfrog realizes that even people who own one of their printers will still need a place to go for larger runs of designs they have printed themselves and tested. </span></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-56" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-300x228.jpg" alt="Extraordinary geometric solid object - toroidal knot as example of modern colorful 3d printing possibility ** Note: Slight blurriness, best at smaller sizes" width="300" height="228" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-300x228.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-1024x778.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587.jpg 1316w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They understand that people come to 3D printing with a goal in mind. In many cases that goal is to solve a problem through design, to test or tweak a design, retest it, or improve upon the design in some other way. And once they solve this problem, the next challenge presents itself.</span></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true you can use your own printer to print hundreds or thousands of design impressions, this is extremely time consuming. Most people don&#8217;t want to babysit their printer for that length of time or expose it to the wear and tear.</p>
<p>Another option for those larger projects is to search 3D printing, roll the dice and hope that you find a printer that can handle your order. You may find a reputable printer in this way but you also spend a lot of time vetting out the companies and people you are talking with.</p>
<p>A third option is to go to the large commercial printers. They have the equipment and manpower to get the job done, they also have the overhead to go with it. This option, albeit a suitable one, can get very expensive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally,  you have the option to use a 3D printing network, one that has the understanding to make sure your job is done right. You&#8217;ll also want a network with a proven process where only high quality printers work on your order. This is why you need Print a Thing comes in.

<p>Print a Thing&#8217;s Community 3D Printing Network.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3D printing community is a close-nit family and word of mouth is everything. With that in mind, we were very excited when the folks at Fabbaloo wrote a nice piece on how easy it is to work with Print a Thing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and how our network is very cost effective compared to the other options out there. </span></p>
<p>You can read the full piece at <a href="http://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2015/5/3/print-a-things-community-3d-printing-network"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2015/5/3/print-a-things-community-3d-printing-network</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strive to give our customers a high quality print that is cost effective along with a great experience and this article did a great job of showcasing our processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many engineers out there currently print their own prototypes on their own printers. They do this to get quick feedback on the design. As they print the first design they have to go through their own trial and error process. They may ultimately need 100 of these parts, but after they have created the design that works best for them, it can be a daunting task to print the full batch themselves. And these professionals certainly have things they&#8217;d rather be doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is where Print a Thing can help. If you have a design you need prints of and you want a trusted and proven network to handle the printing, we can help. Print a Thing’s network of trusted and proven printers will deliver your final product cost effectively and in time frame that meets your needs. And that&#8217;s worth writing about.</span></p>
