<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re in the market for a 3D print, Leapfrog, one of the leaders in the 3D printing industry, is ready to help. But why would a seller of 3D printers <a href="http://www.lpfrg.com/blog/want-to-have-a-3d-print-made/">direct you to services other than selling you a printer?</a> The answer is simple. Leapfrog realizes that even people who own one of their printers will still need a place to go for larger runs of designs they have printed themselves and tested. </span></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-56" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-300x228.jpg" alt="Extraordinary geometric solid object - toroidal knot as example of modern colorful 3d printing possibility ** Note: Slight blurriness, best at smaller sizes" width="300" height="228" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-300x228.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587-1024x778.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rsz_bigstock-extraordinary-geometric-solid-51779587.jpg 1316w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They understand that people come to 3D printing with a goal in mind. In many cases that goal is to solve a problem through design, to test or tweak a design, retest it, or improve upon the design in some other way. And once they solve this problem, the next challenge presents itself.</span></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true you can use your own printer to print hundreds or thousands of design impressions, this is extremely time consuming. Most people don&#8217;t want to babysit their printer for that length of time or expose it to the wear and tear.</p>
<p>Another option for those larger projects is to search 3D printing, roll the dice and hope that you find a printer that can handle your order. You may find a reputable printer in this way but you also spend a lot of time vetting out the companies and people you are talking with.</p>
<p>A third option is to go to the large commercial printers. They have the equipment and manpower to get the job done, they also have the overhead to go with it. This option, albeit a suitable one, can get very expensive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally,  you have the option to use a 3D printing network, one that has the understanding to make sure your job is done right. You&#8217;ll also want a network with a proven process where only high quality printers work on your order. This is why you need Print a Thing comes in.

<p>Print a Thing&#8217;s Community 3D Printing Network.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3D printing community is a close-nit family and word of mouth is everything. With that in mind, we were very excited when the folks at Fabbaloo wrote a nice piece on how easy it is to work with Print a Thing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and how our network is very cost effective compared to the other options out there. </span></p>
<p>You can read the full piece at <a href="http://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2015/5/3/print-a-things-community-3d-printing-network"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2015/5/3/print-a-things-community-3d-printing-network</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strive to give our customers a high quality print that is cost effective along with a great experience and this article did a great job of showcasing our processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many engineers out there currently print their own prototypes on their own printers. They do this to get quick feedback on the design. As they print the first design they have to go through their own trial and error process. They may ultimately need 100 of these parts, but after they have created the design that works best for them, it can be a daunting task to print the full batch themselves. And these professionals certainly have things they&#8217;d rather be doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is where Print a Thing can help. If you have a design you need prints of and you want a trusted and proven network to handle the printing, we can help. Print a Thing’s network of trusted and proven printers will deliver your final product cost effectively and in time frame that meets your needs. And that&#8217;s worth writing about.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Martin a very active author had a great Q &amp; A with our CEO Andy Doucette back in April. They discussed a variety of topics in the 3D printing landscape and also discussed how and why Print a Thing exists in the marketplace. You can read the whole article </span><a href="http://www.solidsmack.com/culture/new-3d-printing-service-print-a-thing-takes-on-shapeways-and-3d-hubs-interview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://www.folditure.com/images/press/logo-solidsmack.png" alt="" width="400" height="100" /></p>
<p>One of the most interesting highlights of the conversation was the comparison between 3D printers and the copy machines you would find at FedEx or Kinkos. Most people who have direct access to a 3D printer use it sporadically after the novelty wears off and that is massive barrier to entry for many people. An investment of more than $20,000 is risky if it will be nothing more than a novelty. But, at the same time, many people want access to the technology and have designs they want printed.</p>
<p>Now compare that to the color copier industry. When a business owner, or salesperson has a large and in-depth proposal and needs access to an amazing color copier they don’t run out and buy a $15,000 color copier.  They run to Kinkos. Print a Thing is trying to bring the same access to 3D printers through our trusted network or printers.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copy-of-6113-07147896c.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-42" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copy-of-6113-07147896c-300x200.jpg" alt="6113-07147896 © Masterfile Royalty-Free Model Release: Yes Property Release: Yes Business people looking at cube in meeting" width="300" height="200" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copy-of-6113-07147896c-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copy-of-6113-07147896c-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copy-of-6113-07147896c.jpg 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second point from the conversation that we find compelling is that the competition in the marketplace comes in two main forms. Commercial printers who have a large amount of overhead outfitting their huge factories with commercial 3D printers, paying employees to run them, paying employees to manage them as well as all the other costs that go into running a huge factory. These excessive costs mean each print is significantly more expensive than what Print a Thing’s trusted network can deliver. The second competitor is the yellow pages of 3D printing &#8211; a list of people who can print &#8211; and you hope it works out.  This method requires you to reach out to providers, wait for a response, find the right fit, understand their costs, get their turnaround time and, again, hope it all works out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print a Thing molds these two worlds together and puts the positive aspects of each all in one place. See how easy it is to get your design printed at <a href="https://printathing.com" target="_blank">https://printathing.com</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we admire about the 3D printing universe is the many people that love to share what they have learned. It&#8217;s that support of one another that has been one of the key reasons for the growth of the 3D printing interesting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarun Tampi is a good example of that sharing. Back in March he wrote an interesting article about the 3D printing marketplace, specifically the crowd-sourced 3D printing services that were available. </span><a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/03/27/print-a-thing-aims-for-mass-distributed-3d-printing/">You can read the full story here.</a></p>
<div style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="http://3dprintingindustry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3D-print-a-thing-suppliers.png" alt="Print A Thing Suppliers" width="1200" height="571" /><p class="wp-caption-text">3D printer hard at work</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarun does a great job of highlighting one of the problems in the crowd-sourced space which is the back and forth between the designer and the supplier. At Print a Thing we strive to make the process easier for both parties by handing all of the communication that needs to take place to get your print done correctly. We strive to be, as Tarun put it, “a 3D printing concierge service.” We do this because we know that if Print a Thing has a high level of service we are going to attract higher level providers to our network and ultimately, more customers and opportunities to share in this growing industry.<br />
