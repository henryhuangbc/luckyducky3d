										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have never been to a Maker Faire it is a cool experience. The Maker Faire has been happening for 10 years and it is very popular in the Bay Area as well as New York. These are not the only Faire locations however as there are events happening across the globe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not familiar with what a Maker Faire is all about&#8230; think about the opposite of an antique roadshow. Rather than people bringing their old fashioned antique items to show and evaluate. People, in this case makers, instead bring things that they create, produce, or make. Often these are artistic crafts. While attendees get to see a variety of creations from many different makers all at once, it becomes a community that shares knowledge and ideas as well as creativity. One of the largest footprints/maker spaces that was showcased this year, was the Portland (PDX) 3D printing lab. If you want to learn more about them and the Maker Movement check them out at </span><a href="http://makerfaire.com/maker-movement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://makerfaire.com/maker-movement/</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print a Thing had one of our team members, Alex Lingle, attend the most recent Faire in Portland. He joined many members of the 3D printing community in the Portland area. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the cool things Alex came across were the folks from </span><a href="http://www.proto-pasta.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proto Pasta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They sell unique exoctic 3D printer filament, stainless steel, magnetic iron, and limited edition aromatic coffee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with these folks will get you into a maker type of mood. </span></p>
<p>There was a wide array of unique 3D printed items. One of my favorites was the violin. It looked cool, sounded great, and added a great vibe to the event.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also see a great deal of 3D printers up close and in action.  Lulzbot, Ultimaker, Plasticfab-3D, M3D, and others.</span></p>
