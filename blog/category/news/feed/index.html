										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a child one of my favorite television shows was The Jetsons. It’s 1980s revival was smack in the middle of my formative years and I would hum along as George Jetson dropped his family off at their chosen destinations for the day on his way to work.</p>
<p>The Jetsons were our prognostications for the future given animated life. They flew around in wheel less cars, lived in the sky, had robot maids and ate food that was quickly created in a machine. The show originally aired in the 60s and nearly 50 years later we still don’t have those flying cars, sky way homes and robot maids, but food made by machines? Well, one out of four isn&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-267" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-300x225.png" alt="US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center" width="300" height="225" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-300x225.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am-285x214.png 285w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen-shot-2016-02-01-at-11.18.35-am.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>US Army Natick Soldier RD&amp;E Center</p>
<p>Today the United States Army is seeking new ways to manage its food supply lines while customizing nutrition and it thinks it’s found a way to make food Jetsons style, through the power of 3D printing. “Food could be printed with the exact requirement a warfighter needs,” Lauren Oleksyk, a food technologist who works at the US Army’s Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center told <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/army-3d-print-soldiers-food-2016-2">Tech Insider</a>.</p>
<p>It sounds impossible, the stuff of, well, The Jetsons but Oleksyk believes the quick manufacturing of food, using 3D printing is not only possible, it’s doable within the next 10-15 years. In fact, it’s prognosticated that by that time our soldiers will be outfitted with devices that measure not only their physiological status but their nutritional status as well and these measurements would be delivered to the solider so he or she was aware of their current status.</p>
<p>The information collected by these devices will then be returned to base as well where officials could use it to print dietary solutions that will correct any deficiencies the soldier is currently showing. The data would also allow them to alter their food printing choices based on the physical body composition of the solider.</p>
<p>Using today’s technology simple foods like peanut butter filling can be made in half an hour but as the technology improves experts expect 3D printers will be able to tackle more complex foodstuffs while also printing simple food stuffs in less time. And once we master the art of printing food bars, can George Jetsen and his flying car really be that far behind?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3D printing is cutting edge technology, that’s one of the reasons we love it. But even those of who live in this industry every single day are constantly amazed at everything this technology is capable of accomplishing. For example, as amazing as this technology is, it&#8217;s even more fantastic when you realize one firm is using it to merge robotics and 3D printing for the future of space work.</p>
<p>It’s the stuff of science fiction made real thanks to Made in Space and its newly unveiled Archinaut.</p>
<p>If you’ve heard the name Made In Space before, it’s because they&#8217;ve been at the forefront of 3D printing innovation for some time. This is the same firm responsible for creating the very first 3D printer that can operate in zero gravity. That technology allows astronauts to build items they may need in space upon receiving the proper program. Now to move beyond the creation of simple tools  and up to larger, items, Made In Space has upped its game by creating Archinaut.</p>
<p>Funded with a two-year, $20 million NASA grant, Made In Space and it’s partners &#8211; <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/Pages/default.aspx">Grumman</a> and <a href="http://www.oceaneering.com/space-systems/">Oceaneering Space Systems</a> – are working on a project that is one part 3D printer and one part robotic arm. The goal is to use the technology to accomplish unique tasks outside the International Space Station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rsz_mis_printer_patch.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-254" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rsz_mis_printer_patch-300x147.jpg" alt="rsz_mis_printer_patch" width="300" height="147" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rsz_mis_printer_patch-300x147.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rsz_mis_printer_patch-1024x503.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rsz_mis_printer_patch.jpg 1661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Archinaut is comprised of a 3D printer and a robotic arm, working together. The arm will be responsible for assembling pieces of a downloaded program that have been made by the printer. This combination enables Archinaut to build creations of a size and scale beyond the printer itself and do all of this with minimal human help. That makes it the ideal option for tackling previously impossible tasks in the black void of space.</p>
<p>Robotic arms assembling new tools and technology outside the International Space Station and it&#8217;s all brought to you by 3D printing. So where will 3D printing go next? We&#8217;re not sure but we can&#8217;t wait to find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is still seven months away but here’s a scary story for those of us in the 3D printing industry. <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/plot-fabricate-and-listen-your-3d-printer-is-telling-people-what-its-making/">New research from a team at the University of California at Irvine,</a> has discovered that it is possible to recreate a 3D printed model solely by making an audio recording of the machine during the creation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rapidtech_110321_01_daa-300x200.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-259" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rapidtech_110321_01_daa-300x200-300x200.jpg" alt="rapidtech_110321_01_daa-300x200" width="300" height="200" /></a>Daniel Anderson / UCI</p>
<p>It sounds like an espionage tacit from a bond film but Professor Mohammad Al Faruque, who headed up the project, insists stealing a 3D printed design solely by recording the sounds made by the extruder’s movements is possible. And he’s done it, working with his team to record a 3D printer’s process, they were able to replicate the same design with an accuracy rate of 90 percent.</p>
<p><strong>The effect on the 3D printing industry</strong></p>
<p>For those of us with a 3D printer in our home, the threat of someone making an audio recording of our printer’s work and thereby stealing our design is likely not that great. It’s also easily protected against. This is not the case however for companies that may have several employees working around a 3D printer every day – each of them with a smart phone capable of recording audio at a quality necessary to possibly replicate the design.</p>
<p>So how can companies protect themselves?</p>
<p>Prohibiting smart phones and other recording devices from areas around 3D printers is a logical solution but also one likely to be protested by employees. A second, simple solution may be to add additional noise interference to the area. Even something as common as a white noise machine could be sufficient to muddy the audio quality and make picking out the exact sounds of the printer impossible.</p>
<p>As 3D printing technology continues to improve, the machines are likely to get quieter. That’s good news in the long-term but for now we’re left with the potential for stolen secrets via audio recordings. Fortunately thwarting this crime is very doable so while the threat may be a little scary, it doesn’t have to give you nightmares.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raise your hand if you had the Play-Doh Fun Factory in the 1980s. Yes, we were the lucky ones. Why with that one simple toy you could press, mold, create and even build your own toys. The fun factory offered limitless potential and as long as mom and dad kept resupplying you with fresh tubs of Play-Doh, boy there was nothing you couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Now fast forward to 2016 and Mattel has just unveiled ThingMaker, a $300 <a href="https://printathing.com/">3D printer </a>that lets kids create their own toys. Suddenly the Fun Factory looks as stale as the Play-Doh we all left on the table.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the Toy Fair in New York, ThingMaker’s 3D printing app works with Autodesk to create a simple interface kids can use to imagine their own projects. The concepts can then be printed on the ThingMaker itself or any other “adult” 3D printer. The app includes a series of templates kids can use to quickly create their own toys. And for those kids that want to create a uniquely original creation, the app has the tools they need to start any project from scratch. There are even options for saving past designs, including the opportunity to upload them to Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://photos.prnewswire.com/featured/prnthumbnew/20160211/332605" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>ThingMaker(TM) 3D Printer and ThingMaker Design(TM) App Eco-System (PRNewsFoto/Mattel, Inc.)</p>
<p>On the surface ThingMaker appears to be a price point 3D printer but it’s much more than that. This is a child’s 3D printer in every positive sense of the word. It is a printer and interface system designed to be simple enough that a child can not only use it but thrive, creating toys of their own. The toys are then printed in parts that kids can use to build their original idea or make bigger and better creations – one of the few similarities that reminds us of our Play-Doh Fun Factory.</p>
<p>Mattel certainly hopes that ThingMaker takes off and as it grows, don’t be surprised to see other popular Mattel lines make a product appearance thanks to this technology. Company executives have already hinted that Hot Wheels and Barbie could get the 3D printed treatment. Maybe our children could even use the ThingMaker to print a toy or two for their dear sweet parents who would love to recapture their youth? I personally know of one home in dire need of a Fun Factory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the digital innovations taking our lives by storm, it’s good to know there’s still some fun out there that doesn’t require a picture screen. Board games are bigger than ever and we’re not talking about the old classics like Battleship, Sorry and Risk. Those games are as outdated as the prices in Monopoly. Though we wouldn’t mind paying $60 for rent.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s board games have evolved to meet the demands of new generation and modern classics include titles such as Five Tribes, Caverna, The Settlers of Catan and deckbuilders like Dominion. Each is a challenging game that rewards strategy over luck and as such, titles like these becoming more and more popular with adults and children alike.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Nepomuk_280_-_Osadn%C3%ADci_z_Katanu.jpg" alt="" width="2872" height="2154" /></p>
<p>In addition to more in-depth strategy, modern board games also offer beautiful components and, as such, are well-cared for by their owners &#8211; who aren’t afraid to spend a little extra money to create that perfect gaming experience.</p>
<p>And that’s where 3D printing comes in.</p>
<p>The recent surge in the popularity of board games has also seen gamers across the world use their 3D printers to create the perfect accessories, like this <a href="http://printathing.com/blog/find-the-best-3d-printed-gear-for-your-games-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">handy token holder</a> for Fantasy Flight Games’ amazingly popular X-Wing Miniatures Game. The holder, designed by Matt Terry, is perfect for any game session, bringing chaos to this epic galactic struggle. Terry was kind enough to share his design so other gamers could use it as well and that got us thinking: Are there other game component designs out there that 3D printers would like to share?</p>
<p>We want to hear from you, as a gamer or a 3D printer, what other gaming concepts have you created that you would like to share with the gaming community? <a href="http://www.printathing.com">Contact us today </a>to let us know more about your design and we can feature it on our website to be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</p>
<p>Because in our modern digital age, there’s still nothing better than a traditional helping hand.</p>

<p>3D printing technology is creating new solutions for people all across our world – and a recent contest shows it’s even expanding options beyond the earth as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.marsicehouse.com/">Ice House</a>, created by SEArch/Clouds Architecture Office, is a <a href="https://printathing.com/">3D printed</a> shell design for a building that would enable researchers to work safely on Mars. The design is the product of hard work by a 12-person team that includes 3D printing engineers, geologists, astrophysicists and structural engineers. The shell shows such promise that it took home first place in <a href="http://3dpchallenge.tumblr.com/">NASA’s 3D Printed Habitat Challenge Design Competition</a>. According to contest guidelines, designers were challenged to create a design for a 3D printed structure that scientists could use for work on Mars. In addition to being functional, the design also had to be appropriate for the planet’s environment and make use of existing natural resources.</p>
<p>So how does the Ice House work?</p>
<p>Think of it like an igloo, just geared for a much more hostile environment – specifically Mars’ northern hemisphere. The shell is 5 centimeters thick and features a smaller, nesting dome inside. All of this is designed to protect human visitors to the red planet from Mars’ inherent frigid temperatures and radiation. The Ice House is so secure it will even allow the team to conduct their research without the requirement of any protective suit. And the shell will also pull double duty protecting the planet itself from any human contamination.</p>
<p>The Ice House finished first of 165 entrees in the habitat challenge and for lovers of the 3D printing craft, it’s worth a quick browse through the other top <a href="http://3dpchallenge.tumblr.com/">entrants on the list</a>.</p>
<p>“The creativity and depth of the designs we’ve seen have impressed us,” Centennial Challenges Program Manager Monsi Roman said in <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/3DPHab/2015winners.html">this press release</a>. “These teams were not only imaginative and artistic with their entries, but they also really took into account the life-dependent functionality our future space explorers will need in an off-Earth habitat.”</p>
<p>For the team at SEArch/Clouds Architecture Office, this is an exciting victory and for those of us in the 3D printing world, it’s just further proof of <a href="https://printathing.com/inspire/">what doors can be opened</a> with this amazing technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">At Print a Thing we always say “What would you like to make today?” because we firmly believe that anything is possible with 3D printing and that this technology can take your dreams to a whole other level. Jim, at Grass Roots Engineering, is taking that idea one step further by using 3D printing to literally transport himself thanks to his own 3D printed kayak. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">The vessel, which Jim says cost him about $500 to make, is 16.5 feet long and made from ABS plastic, screws, a little caulk and a handful of inserts. It’s a colorful design that incorporates 28 different 3D printed sections, which are connected by thermoplastic brass inserts, and most importantly, it floats. Jim says he’s already traveled around in it several times. You can even see pictures of him doing so </span><a href="http://www.grassrootsengineering.com/blog/page/2/"><span style="color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;">in his blog here.</span></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://www.grassrootsengineering.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kayak_001.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">In order to tackle such a large project and prevent warping and cracking, Jim had to make a few modifications to his 3D printer. You can learn more about those modifications </span><a href="http://www.grassrootsengineering.com/blog/mymachine/"><span style="color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;">here</span></a><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">. The finished product features a hull that is 6mm thick and includes a complete ribbing structure for added strength and stability. There are even points where handles, cameras or other items can be added at a later date. You can learn more about all of the exact measurements of the kayak on the </span><a href="http://www.grassrootsengineering.com/blog/page/2/"><span style="color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;">Grass Roots Engineering blog</span></a><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">. Great work Jim! Your kayak is certainly one of a kind. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So what would you like to make today? Whatever it is, 3D printing can help you do it. Every single time we think we understand the boundaries of this amazing technology people like Jim come along and completely reopen the realm of what 3D printing is capable of doing. So start your planning, expand your horizons and determine the answer for yourself.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game from <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/">Fantasy Flight Games</a> is taking the galaxy by storm. Whether you command the noble Rebellion, the evil Empire or slink around the table with Scum and Villainy, this game is delighting gamers everywhere.</p>
<p>To compete for control of the galaxy you need the beautiful miniatures created by Fantasy Flight Games and you also need all of the associated dice and tokens that chronicle your wartime efforts. But as the battle intensifies and more ships are added to the conflict, it gets easy to lose those tokens into hyperspace.</p>
<p>And that’s where 3D printing can help. This <a href="http://sphism.github.io/xwing/">handy token holder</a> was designed by Matt Terry and it’s the perfect accessory when you’re looking to bring order to a galaxy full of chaos. Matt’s efficient model has six slots perfectly designed to hold the game’s essential tokens, allowing you to draw the one you need – or you&#8217;re forced to place – when the moment calls for it.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-Printing-Plastic-Wire-with-D-51194164.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-192" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-Printing-Plastic-Wire-with-D-51194164-300x237.jpg" alt="Printing Plastic Wire with 3D Printer" width="300" height="237" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-Printing-Plastic-Wire-with-D-51194164-300x237.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-Printing-Plastic-Wire-with-D-51194164.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">What’s on your desk when you come to the office every day? A computer? Writing tools? Pictures of loved ones? What about a 3D printer?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Those first couple of items adorn the desks of most professionals, no matter what field they are in. And you&#8217;ll see the same tools o the desks of engineers as well. However, while engineers certainly have a need for 3D printers, there are precious few who have such technology in their offices. And even fewer who have them at their desks. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">That needs to change. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Just as the idea of having a computer at every work station was inconceivable a generation ago, we can no longer afford to discount the importance of having access to <a href="https://printathing.com/">3D printing capabilities </a>in the office environment for those that need them. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Some forward-thinking companies are already making the upfront investment to expand 3D printing capabilities in their office space. Those that have moved to adding 3D printers to individual work stations are finding they are saving money with individual units when compared to central printing hubs. That’s thanks to the reduced price of supplying desktop 3D printers with filament compared to their larger counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Other companies remark that adding 3D printers to their engineers’ work spaces has encouraged their staff to be more creative and try out new ideas they may have never considered officially printing otherwise. Engineers with 3D printers at their desks are essentially using the tool as their sketch pads, just as their colleagues used a pencil and paper a generation ago. And as any engineer knows, sometimes the greatest ideas are spawned by from the simplest ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So are we headed for a day when 3D printers adorn the desk of every engineering workstation? Eventually yes, but you probably don’t need to clear a spot tomorrow. It’s an exciting prospect nevertheless because an increased mainstreaming of 3D printers represents growth for our industry as well as yours. Here’s to your new workmate, we look forward to see what you come up with together.</span></p>
